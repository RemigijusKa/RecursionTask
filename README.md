# RecursionTask
The program creates Binary data tree and calculates the deepest level of that tree. 

Tree structure: 
		      	6
		       / \
		      4	  9
		         / \
	      		7  11
		       /\    \
		      3 10   15
			           /\
			          8  20

There are two recursive methods in this program. First is used to insert data into tree, in a way it becomes a binary search tree. Another recursive method looks for a deepest level of a tree. 

Empty tree has 0 levels.
Tree with just one root node has 1 level.
The tree shown in example has the deepest level of 5.
